# Title

Project-Cycle

## Description

This game is a roguelike adventure focused on deep character customization and replayability. Each run begins with the creation of a new character, allowing players to choose their appearance and class or randomize them for a quick start. After creation, the character enters a central hub world that serves as a safe zone for shopping, interacting with NPCs, and preparing for exploration.

From the hub, players can venture into one of seven distinct biomes—plains, desert, tundra, tropical, forest, mountain, and volcano. Each biome offers multiple area types to explore, including overworld, underground, haunted, and tower zones. The palace area within each biome remains locked until the player discovers a key hidden within that region.

Defeating the palace boss rewards the player with a special key. Collecting all seven keys unlocks the final dungeon, where the ultimate challenge awaits. Completing the final dungeon concludes the run.

Death is permanent. If the player’s character falls, a new run begins with a new character. Previously used cosmetics and classes become temporarily unavailable, encouraging experimentation and adaptation with each attempt. The cycle of creation, exploration, and discovery drives the game’s core experience, blending strategic progression with the unpredictability of roguelike gameplay.
